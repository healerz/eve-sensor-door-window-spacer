# Base Plate And Spacer for EVE Door & Window Sensor

A 3D printable spacer system designed to optimize the mounting of the [**EVE Door & Window Sensor**](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window). This includes multiple spacer sizes (3.5 mm to 20 mm) with clean press-fit assembly and standalone wall-mount variants.

## Overview

This project provides a set of modular, 3D printable spacers specifically for the EVE Door & Window Sensor. With multiple heights and standalone wall-mount configurations, it offers a more flexible installation experience than the standard package.

- **Product**: Spacer / Wall-mount system designed for [**EVE Door & Window Sensor**](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window)
- **License**: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
- **Two Styles**: Spacers or standalone wall-mount plates
- **Available in 5 Sizes**: 0 mm, 3.5 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm variants  
- **Ready-to-Print**: Includes `.stl` and `.3mf` files
- **Two-Part Print (Spacers only)**: For easier printing (press-fit assembly)
- **Material**: PLA, PETG, or other commonly used filament types

## Installation

### Included Variants

#### Wall-Mount / Base Versions  
Each wall mount includes the base and platform as a unified component:
| Height | File                                                                                                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 mm   | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase0mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase0mm.stl)    |
| 3.5 mm | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase3.5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase3.5mm.stl)|
| 5 mm   | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase5mm.stl)    |
| 10 mm  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase10mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase10mm.stl)  |
| 20 mm  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase20mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase20mm.stl)  |

#### Spacer-Only Versions  
Designed to be used between the wall mount base plate and the sensor. Each consists of a two-part press-fit design:
| Height | File                                                                                                    |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.5 mm | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer3.5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer3.5mm.stl)|
| 5 mm   | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer5mm.stl)    |
| 10 mm  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer10mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer10mm.stl)  |
| 20 mm  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer20mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer20mm.stl)  |

### Printing Instructions

1. **Download the Files**  
   Models are provided in both `.stl` and `.3mf` formats.
   You can download the models via [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/your-model-id-here).

2. **Slicing Recommendations**
   - Layer Height: `0.2mm`  
   - Infill: `20%` (Grid or Cubic)  
   - Supports: Required for optimal result
   - Material: PLA or PETG  
   - Orientation: Default model orientation is optimal

3. **Printing Notes**  
   Only the **spacer variants** are split into two parts (a back plate and a front platform) for better printability. Wall-mount models are single-piece designs.

### Assembly Instructions

For spacer variants (two-part models):
1. Remove any supports and clean contact surfaces if needed.
2. Press the two parts together — no glue is typically required.  
   - The fit is held by five circular pillars designed to press-fit into matching holes.
   - A clamp or vise can help if extra force is needed.
   - If the press-fit is too tight, lightly sanding the posts may help.

Mount the assembled piece to the surface, then attach the EVE sensor.

## Usage

These spacers help with proper alignment of the [**EVE Door & Window Sensor**](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window) during installation. This system offers additional flexibility in mounting configurations. E.g. aligning the sensor when door/window frames are thick.
