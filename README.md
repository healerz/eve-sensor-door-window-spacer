# Base Plate And Spacer for EVE Door & Window Sensor

A 3D printable spacer system designed to optimize the mounting of the [EVE Door & Window Sensor](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window). This includes multiple spacer sizes (3.5 mm to 20 mm) with clean press-fit assembly and standalone wall-mount variants.

## Overview

This project provides a set of modular, 3D printable spacers specifically for the EVE Door & Window Sensor. With multiple heights and standalone wall-mount configurations, it offers a more flexible installation experience than the standard package.

- **Product**: Spacer / Wall-mount system designed for [EVE Door & Window Sensor](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window)
- **License**: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
- **Two Styles**: Spacers or standalone wall-mount plates
- **Available in 5 Sizes**: 0 mm, 3.5 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm variants  
- **Ready-to-Print**: Includes `.stl` and `.3mf` files
- **Two-Part Print (Spacers only)**: For easier printing (press-fit assembly)
- **Material**: PLA, PETG, or other commonly used filament types

## Installation

### Included Variants

#### Wall-Mount / Base Versions  
Each wall mount includes the base and platform as a unified component:
| Height | Filament  | File                                                                                                                  |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 mm   | 3g (8g)   | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase0mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase0mm.stl)    |
| 3.5 mm | 5g (12g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase3.5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase3.5mm.stl)|
| 5 mm   | 5g (13g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase5mm.stl)    |
| 10 mm  | 7g (15g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase10mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase10mm.stl)  |
| 15 mm  | 9g (17g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase15mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase15mm.stl)  |
| 20 mm  | 11g (18g) | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase20mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorWallmountBase20mm.stl)  |

#### Spacer Versions  
Designed to be used between the wall mount base plate and the sensor. Each consists of a two-part press-fit design:
| Height | Filament  | File                                                                                                    |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.5 mm | 6g (14g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer3.5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer3.5mm.stl)|
| 5 mm   | 7g (15g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer5mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer5mm.stl)    |
| 10 mm  | 9g (17g)  | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer10mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer10mm.stl)  |
| 15 mm  | 11g (19g) | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer15mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer10mm.stl)  |
| 20 mm  | 13g (21g) | [3mf](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer20mm.3mf), [stl](models/EveDoorAndWindowSensorSpacer20mm.stl)  |

### Printing Instructions

1. **Download the Files**  
   Models are provided in both `.stl` and `.3mf` formats.
   You can download the models via [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/your-model-id-here).

2. **Slicing Recommendations**
   - Supports: Required for optimal result
   - Material: PETG  
   - Orientation: Default model orientation is recommended

3. **Printing Notes**  
   Only the spacer variants are split into two parts (a back plate and a front platform) for better printability. Wall-mount models are single-piece designs.

### Assembly Instructions

For spacer variants (two-part models):
1. Remove any supports and clean contact surfaces if needed.
2. Press the two parts together — no glue is typically required.  
   - The fit is held by five circular pillars designed to press-fit into matching holes.
   - A clamp or vise can help if extra force is needed.
   - If the press-fit is too tight, lightly sanding the posts may help.

Mount the assembled piece to the surface, then attach the EVE sensor.

## Usage

These spacers help with proper alignment of the [EVE Door & Window Sensor](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window) during installation. This system offers additional flexibility in mounting configurations. E.g. aligning the sensor when door/window frames are thick.

## Known Issues

### Fragile L-Shaped Overhang (All Variants)

All variants feature a small L-shaped overhang that supports the sensor platform. This element is only 1.8 mm thick at the base where it connects to the main body, making it susceptible to breakage under mechanical stress, especially when printed in brittle materials like PLA or PETG.

If you have suggestions or ideas for overcoming this structural weakness, feel free to share them.
