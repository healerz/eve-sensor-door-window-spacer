# EVE Door & Window Sensor Wallmount Base Plate And Spacer

A 3D printable spacer system designed to optimize the mounting of the [**EVE Door & Window Sensor**](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window). This includes multiple spacer sizes, standalone wall-mount variants, and a split model design for improved printability and flexibility.

## Overview

This project provides a set of modular, 3D printable spacers specifically for the EVE Door & Window Sensor. With multiple heights and standalone wall-mount configurations, it offers a more flexible installation experience than the standard package.

- **Product**: Spacer / Wall-mount system for [**EVE Door & Window Sensor**](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window)
- **Material**: PLA, PETG, or other commonly used filament types  
- **License**: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

## Installation

### Included Variants

#### Wall-Mount / Base Versions  
Each wall mount includes the base and platform as a unified component:
- `wall_mount_0mm`
- `wall_mount_3.5mm`
- `wall_mount_5mm`
- `wall_mount_10mm`
- `wall_mount_20mm`

#### Spacer-Only Versions  
Designed to be used between the wall mount base plate and the sensor. Each consists of a two-part press-fit design:
- `spacer_3.5mm`
- `spacer_5mm`
- `spacer_10mm`
- `spacer_20mm`

### Printing Instructions

1. **Download the Files**  
   Models are provided in both `.stl` and `.3mf` formats.
   You can also download the models via [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/your-model-id-here).

2. **Slicing Recommendations**
   - Layer Height: `0.2mm`  
   - Infill: `20%` (Grid or Cubic)  
   - Supports: Required for optimal result
   - Material: PLA or PETG  
   - Orientation: Default model orientation is optimal

3. **Printing Notes**  
   Only the **spacer variants** are split into two parts (a back plate and a front platform) for better printability. Wall-mount models are single-piece designs.

### Assembly Instructions

For spacer variants (two-part models):
1. Remove any supports and clean contact surfaces if needed.
2. Press the two parts together ‚Äî no glue is typically required.  
   - The fit is held by **five circular pillars** designed to press-fit into matching holes.
   - A clamp or vise can help if extra force is needed.

Mount the assembled piece to the surface, then attach the EVE sensor.
